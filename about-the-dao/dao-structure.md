# ðŸ“š DAO Structure

### Governance Roles

The DAO has three types distinct types of governance roles.

#### Members

Anyone and everyone is welcome to be a Member of the DAO.

As per the foundation's [bylaws](https://github.com/Developer-DAO/the-developer-dao-foundation/blob/main/foundation-docs/Bylaws%20-%20The%20Developer%20DAO%20Foundation.pdf), a Member is anyone who holds any number of CODE tokens. Members can participate in Governance by submitting proposals to the forum and voting on Snapshot.

Members are typically rewarded in CODE tokens for their participation in the DAO and other ways when taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the DAO. For example:

1. Bounties in hackathons run by the DAO.
2. Sponsored travel to participate in IRL Hackathons (i.e. ETH Global).
3. Access to unique offers, benefits and discounts with our partners.

#### Contributors

Contributors are people who work for the DAO.

Like Members, Contributors are rewarded in CODE for participating in the DAO; however, they're also paid in stablecoins for performing a specific role.&#x20;

Opportunities to become a Contributor are typically made available to the most active Members of the DAO who have shown an interest in contributing.

#### Stewards

Stewards are Members who are trusted with an elevated role in governance.

They are elected every quarter and rewarded in CODE for their contributions.&#x20;

### Sub-DAOs

In Developer DAO, the term Sub-DAO is synonymous with a workstream or team.

A Sub-DAO is an entity or group of Contributors delegated responsibility for a Domain of Operations by Members via Developer DAO Improvement Proposals (DDIP).

Sub-DAOs are the atomic units of how Developer DAO advances its mission. As such, ratifying Sub-DAOs sets boundaries on what is and isnâ€™t in the scope of DAO governance.

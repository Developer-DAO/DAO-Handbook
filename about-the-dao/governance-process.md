# ðŸ‘©âš– Governance Process

## Scope of Developer DAO Governance

The following areas are currently under the Governance of Developer DAO Members:

* Any decision that impacts the Treasury balance or allocation that is not already accounted for in a previous proposal.
* Anything that impacts the Governance of the DAO
* Anything that impacts the â€œThe Developer DAO Foundation" including its Articles and ByLaws.

Anything outside of this can be performed freely within pre-determined structures and mechanisms in the DAO.

## Governance Process

### Phase 0: Discussions

This phase is optional. However, it is recommended to have discussions in an open forum before submitting a proposal since a successful proposal will need to gather momentum among members.

| **Duration** | There is no specified time on how long a proposal remains in this phase |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Who**      | Anyone can post                                                         |
| **Where**    | General Category on the forum                                           |

### Phase 2: Developer DAO Improvement Proposal (DDIP)

A DDIP  provides a structured overview of the proposal that acts as the basis for further discussions and also as a foundation for decision-making during the next phase.

|                  |                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Duration**     | Minum 5 days (120 hours)       |
| **Who**          | Anyone can create a DDIP       |
| **Where**        | Proposal category on the forum |
| **Requirements** | Must follow INSERT\_GUIDELINES |

### Phase 3: Snapshot Vote

The final ratification of a DDIP requires a successful vote of Members on the [devdao.eth Sanpshot space](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/)

| **Duration**     | 5 days (120 hours)                             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Who**          | Stewards                                       |
| **Where**        | [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/) |
| **Requierments** | INSERT\_REQUIRMENTS                            |

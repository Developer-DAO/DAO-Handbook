# ‚úç Publish on our blog

## Why write in the first place? ü§î

Writing is a superpower.

It helps consolidate your thoughts and understanding of topics, spreads knowledge and can have a compounding positive impact on your career, as once it's out there, it's there forever.

Check out the success stories below from members who've published on the blog.

## What does the DAO publish?

Our blog aims to educate developers, give educated opinions on popular development topics, and share the experiences of the D\_D members.

There are currently three types of blog submissions we're accepting that have associated rewards:

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th width="197">Theme</th><th width="325.3333333333333">Description</th><th>Reward</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Technical Tutorials</td><td>Intermediate and expert article content that educates developers about specific topics, concepts, protocols or tools.</td><td>XXX USD</td></tr><tr><td>WAGMI</td><td>A place for a community member to share their personal stories on the DAO blog to inspire others.</td><td>XXX CODE</td></tr><tr><td>Open Submission</td><td>Open submission for opinion pieces or any other ideas you think would be valuable for our members and audience to read</td><td>XXX CODE</td></tr></tbody></table>

We especially aim to cover topics that can't be found elsewhere or cover commonly discussed topics in greater depth so readers come away with a deeper understanding of essential topics rather than just a simple introduction.

You can read some of our most viewed articles below:

## How do I get my employer's content published on the blog?

Thanks for your interest.

Publishing to our blog is reserved for Members to give them a platform to share their knowledge, be rewarded, and increase their profile in the industry. If you are a Member and you work for a protocol, the blog is not a platform for you to promote your employer.

We deal with such requests on a case-by-case basis. If your content is mostly agnostic of your employer's product or protocol (i.e. the content has value beyond just using their product), we may consider publishing it. However, if it is highly focused on the product or protocol and has no real value outside of using it, it will likely be rejected.

You can reach out to partnerships@developerdao.com if you're interested in a partnership.

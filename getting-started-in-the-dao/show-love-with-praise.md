## What is Praise?

Praise is an open-source tool we use in Discord to empower Members to recognise each other contributors to the DAO in a peer-to-peer fashion. Per the latest [Labs budget](https://snapshot.org/#/devdao.eth/proposal/0xa4e9c1cf86839fb6682ceed5e2b33d95ba4182aa4bb6072840fcddd5e66370e7), 5,000 CODE is allocated to Members each month based on the Praise they receive.

You can read more about it on the Praise docs below.

## How does Praise work?

Praise has two interfaces Members interact with to issue and receive peer-to-peer rewards from one another.&#x20;
